<!-- git commands -->

<!--  if the commands were not work then we should first write these two commands :
  
       >> git config --global user.name "Ramu-2003"
       >> git config --global user.email "ramu4012y@email.com"
       
       
       >> git init 
       >> git status
       >> git add .    [or]  git add index.html styles.css
       >> git remote add origin https://github.com/Ramu-2003/Zomato-Landing-Page.git
       >> git commit -m "any message"
       >> git branch -m master         [or]  main
       >> git push -u origin master    [or]  main

       >> if we have modified the file in vs then the file will show "m" means modified so we need to re push
       so by using git push it wont work for git bash , so we need to type
       the above commands until git commit then we need to type the below command
       >> git --set-upstream origin master

       >> if we have modified in github that we need to maintain in the vs code so we have to use :
       Git pull origin master

       >> git checkout -b  branch name

       ex : git checkout -b setup {now setup will become the another branch}

       >>  git checkout master

       >> this command to change the branch from like current branch name is "setup" i want to move to "master" 
       then we will use to shift to that branch
